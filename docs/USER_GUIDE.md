## Example Conversations

### Conversation 1: Understanding Deductibles
```
You: "What is a deductible?"
Meera: "A deductible is the amount you must pay for covered healthcare services before your insurance plan starts to pay. For example, if your deductible is $1,500, you pay the first $1,500 of covered services yourself."

You: "How does that work with my Gold plan?"
Meera: "In your Gold plan, you have a $1,000 deductible for individual coverage. This means you pay the first $1,000 of covered medical expenses each year before your insurance begins to pay its share."

You: "What happens after I meet the deductible?"
Meera: "After meeting your $1,000 deductible, you typically pay only copayments or coinsurance for covered services. For example, you might pay a $25 copay for office visits and 20% coinsurance for other services."
```

### Conversation 2: Coverage Comparison
```
You: "What's the difference between Gold and Bronze plans?"
Meera: "The Gold plan has a $1,000 deductible with 20% coinsurance, while the Bronze plan has a $6,000 deductible with 40% coinsurance. Gold plans generally have higher premiums but lower out-of-pocket costs when you need care."

You: "Which is better for someone who visits the doctor frequently?"
Meera: "The Gold plan would be better for frequent doctor visits because you'll reach the lower deductible faster and then pay less in copays and coinsurance. The Bronze plan is better for those who rarely need medical care."

You: "What about prescription coverage?"
Meera: "Both plans cover prescription drugs, but the Gold plan has lower copays: $10 for generic, $30 for brand-name, and $50 for specialty drugs. The Bronze plan has higher copays: $25 for generic, $50 for brand-name, and $100 for specialty drugs."
```

## Advanced Tips

### 1. Use Natural Language
Meera understands natural language, so you can ask questions the way you'd ask a human:
- "I'm confused about how deductibles work"
- "Can you help me understand my coverage?"
- "What should I know about filing claims?"

### 2. Leverage Context
Since Meera remembers your conversation, you can:
- Reference previous answers: "You mentioned the $1000 deductible..."
- Build on information: "Given what you said about coverage..."
- Compare options: "How does that compare to..."

### 3. Ask for Examples
When dealing with complex concepts:
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "What does that mean in practice?"
- "Show me how this works with a real scenario"

### 4. Use Progressive Disclosure
Start with broad questions, then get more specific:
1. "What does my policy cover?"
2. "What about dental coverage?"
3. "What are the limitations on dental procedures?"
4. "How much do I pay for fillings?"
